Maybe the rumpus-room can be more than us sharing HW...

If you have any really good coding music or just song recs in general you can share them here for everyone in this APCS class to appreciate.

If you feel brave...  
Make a folder with your name and song recs

If you don't...  
Add music to the Anon folder  
(We can see it in the commit author anyway.)

Try to categorize music under Artist name in Anon so that it doesn't become crowded

ABOVE ALL PLEASE LOOK UP YOUR SONG AND FIND THE PROPER TITLE SO WE CAN FIND IT...  
IF YOU WANNA GO ONE STEP FARTHER THEN ADD WHERE YOU FOUND IT AS WELL

suggested format:

    //where can find
    artist1:
        song1
        song2
    artist2
