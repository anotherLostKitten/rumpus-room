Maybe the rumpus-room can be more than us
sharing HW...

If you have any really good coding music
or just song recs in general you can share them here
for everyone in this APCS1 class to appreciate.

If you feel brave...
Make a folder with your name and song recs

If you don't...
Add music to the Anon folder

Try to categorize music under Artist name
in Anon so that it doesn't become crowded
